  "content": "# UVM Phases & Agents — Building Reusable Testbenches\n\nUVM phasing and component architecture are core to creating scalable testbenches. This post outlines phases (build, connect, run, extract) and the role of agents, drivers, monitors, and scoreboards.\n\n## Anatomy of an Agent\n- **Driver**: converts transactions to pin-level signals.\n- **Monitor**: observes signals and creates transactions (TLM).\n- **Sequencer/Sequence**: drives driver with sequence_items.\n- **Scoreboard**: compares DUT output with reference model.\n\n## Learning resources\n- UVMkit: https://www.uvmkit.com/\n- go2uvm / community projects: https://github.com/go2uvm\n\n*References: UVMkit, go2uvm*",
