  "content": "# SVA in Practice — Writing Effective SystemVerilog Assertions\n\nSystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) help you catch protocol and temporal bugs early. This post covers practical patterns — immediate vs concurrent assertions, disable guards, parameterized properties, and sequences for reuse.\n\n## Why SVA matters\n- Guard temporal properties that simulation tests may miss.\n- Make intent explicit and enable formal checking.\n\n## Practical tips\n1. **Disable during reset**: Use `disable iff (reset)` to avoid spurious failures.\n2. **Use sequences**: Encapsulate recurring behaviors as sequences and reuse them across properties.\n3. **Layer assertions**: Start with simple checks then add more specific temporal assertions for quicker debug.\n\n## Example\n```systemverilog
property p_req_ack; @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (req |-> ##[1:3] ack);
endproperty
assert property (p_req_ack) else $error("Req->Ack missing");
```
