  "content": "# Chasing Heisenbugs — Debugging Intermittent Races\n\nIntermittent failures are hard to reproduce. This post outlines a pragmatic workflow: capture seeds, add instrumentation, use waveforms selectively, and reduce to minimal reproducer.\n\n## Steps\n1. Save seeds and sample waveforms when failures occur.\n2. Increase logging with unique identifiers and assertion context.\n3. Use binary-search and directed tests to shrink the problem window.\n4. Consider formal or exhaustive techniques if the window is small and control logic-heavy.\n\n## References\n- Doulos debugging tips: https://lnkd.in/g8niZ2pz\n- Growdv & blog references: https://www.growdv.com/\n\n*References: Doulos, GrowDV*",
