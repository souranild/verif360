  "content": "# Formal Verification — When to Use It & Practical Properties\n\nFormal verification complements simulation: use it for exhaustive corner cases, deadlock checks, and proving invariants. This post covers Bounded Model Checking (BMC), induction, and writing assumptions.\n\n## Use cases\n- Protocol invariants (mutual exclusion, deadlock freedom).\n- Corner-case checks that are hard to reach by random sims.\n\n## Example property\n```systemverilog
property p_mutual_excl; @(posedge clk) !(grant1 && grant2);
endproperty
assert property(p_mutual_excl) else $error("Mutual exclusion violated");
```
