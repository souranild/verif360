  "content": "# Weighted Coverage — Focusing Tests on Rare but Critical Events\n\nSome system behaviors are rare but high-risk. Design coverpoints and assign weights to ensure they receive attention in regression cycles.\n\n## Strategy\n- Add bins for rare events and use weights to prioritize them in reports.\n- Create targeted sequences that force rare conditions for regression.\n- Balance distribution so production-like behavior remains visible.\n\n## Example\n```
coverpoint pkt.type { bins normal = {0}; bins rare_error = {1}; bins corruption = {2}; }
// give 'corruption' higher weight or add a directed sequence to exercise it.
```
