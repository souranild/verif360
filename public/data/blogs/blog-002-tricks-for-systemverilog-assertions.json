  "content": "## 69 Powerful Tricks for SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)\n\nSystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) are a cornerstone of modern functional verification. But beyond the basics, there are several advanced techniques that can make your assertions more expressive, maintainable, and effective. Here are seven tricks every verification engineer should know:\n\n### 1. Use Sequences for Reusability\nEncapsulate common behaviors in sequences and reference them in multiple properties. This keeps your code DRY and modular.\n\n### 2. Layer Assertions for Debugging\nWrite simple assertions first, then layer more complex ones. This helps isolate failures and speeds up debugging.\n\n### 3. Leverage Implication Operators\nUse `|->` and `|=>` to clearly express cause-effect relationships.\n\n### 4. Parameterize Your Assertions\nMake your assertions generic by using parameters, so they can be reused across modules.\n\n### 5. Use Cover Properties\nDon’t just check for failures—use `cover property` to track important events and improve coverage.\n\n### 6. Add Meaningful Messages\nAlways include custom messages in your assertions to make debug logs more informative.\n\n### 7. Control Assertion Firing\nUse `disable iff` to prevent assertions from firing during reset or other irrelevant conditions.\n\nMastering these tricks will help you write assertions that are not only correct, but also maintainable and insightful.\n\n---\n\n*Written by Souranil Das*\n",
