  "content": "# Scoreboards & Checkers — Verifying Streaming Protocols\n\nStreaming protocols need strong checkers and scoreboards to ensure ordering, no drops, and no duplicates. This post explains how to construct monitors, reference models, and scoreboards.\n\n## Approach\n- Transactionize signals in monitors.\n- Maintain expected queues and compare observed transactions.\n- Log contextual diagnostics for mismatches.\n\n## Example approach (pseudo)\n```
expected_q.push(expected_txn);
on observed:
 if (expected_q.empty) -> report unexpected;
 else if (observed != expected_q.peek) -> report mismatch;
 else -> expected_q.pop();
```
