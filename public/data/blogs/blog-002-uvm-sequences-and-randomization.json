  "content": "# UVM Sequences & Constrained-Random — Generating Useful Packets\n\nConstrained-random is powerful when you define legal, performant constraints and use sequences to exercise the DUT. This post covers sequence_item design, constraints best practices, and strategies for reproducible tests.\n\n## Best practices\n- Use range constraints (e.g., `addr inside {[8'h10:8'hEF]}`) instead of enumerating huge lists.\n- Avoid heavy cross-field constraints; use pre_randomize/post_randomize for derived fields.\n- Use `randcase` or `weights` to bias rare scenarios when needed.\n\n## Example sketch (pseudo)\n```systemverilog
class pkt extends uvm_sequence_item; rand bit [7:0] addr; rand bit [31:0] data; constraint legal_addr { addr inside {[8'h10:8'hEF]}; } endclass
// sequence: randomize, start_item, finish_item
