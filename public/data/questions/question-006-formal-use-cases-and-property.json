  "description": "Scenario: Two arbiters might accidentally grant simultaneously — not acceptable. Explain when you'd use formal vs more simulation, and write an SVA property that asserts mutual exclusion for grant1 and grant2, describing any assumptions required for soundness.\n\nDiagram (timeline):\n  clk:   ↑   ↑   ↑\n  grant1: 0   1   0\n  grant2: 0   0   1\n\nAlso discuss Bounded Model Checking (BMC) vs induction for proving the property.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "assert property (@(posedge clk) !(grant1 && grant2));",
      "output": "Formal tools or simulation-based assertion checking find violations where both grant1 and grant2 are asserted simultaneously.",
      "explanation": "Formal is excellent for exhaustive corner-case proof (deadlocks or mutual exclusion)."
    }

  "constraints": "Formal checks typically require a reset and stable environment constraints for soundness.",
