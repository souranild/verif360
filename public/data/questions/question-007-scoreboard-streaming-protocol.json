  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["testbench", "scoreboard", "monitor", "protocol"],
  "description": "Scenario: Your DUT processes streaming packets that must preserve order and not drop or duplicate packets. Design a scoreboard that compares observed output transactions to expected reference model results and flags ordering, duplication or loss.\n\nDiagram (flow):\n  tx_in -> DUT -> tx_out\n  Expected sequence: [P0, P1, P2, ...]\n  Observed sequence: [P0, P2, P1, ...]  (ordering violation)",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "Expected: [0x10, 0x11, 0x12]\nObserved: [0x10, 0x12, 0x11]",
      "output": "Scoreboard reports ordering violation at index 1: expected 0x11 but saw 0x12",
      "explanation": "Maintain a queue of expected transactions and compare each observed transaction in-order; log mismatches and context."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": "Assume a single producer and consumer; timestamps may be used for ordering but be careful with out-of-order delivery due to parallelism.",
  "hints": [
    "Use transaction-level abstraction (structs/objects) for packets.",
    "Keep a reference model (e.g., a simple FIFO) to derive expected outputs.",
    "Record context (cycle, sequence id) when reporting mismatches."
  ],
  "solution": {
    "language": "pseudo",
    "code": "// Pseudo: scoreboard logic\nexpected_q.push(expected_transaction);\nwhen observed_transaction arrives:\n  if expected_q.empty() -> report unexpected\n  else if observed != expected_q.peek() -> report ordering/duplication/loss and attempt recovery\n  else expected_q.pop();"
