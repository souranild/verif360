  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["systemverilog", "assertions", "sva"],
  "description": "Explain the difference between immediate and concurrent assertions and give a concurrent SVA example (req implies ack within 1–3 cycles) that is disabled during reset.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (req |-> ##[1:3] ack));",
      "output": "Checks that whenever req is true, ack follows within 1 to 3 clock cycles; assertion ignored while reset is asserted.",
      "explanation": "This is a concurrent assertion (temporal) with 'disable iff' guarding reset."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": "Signals must be sampled on the same clock domain.",
  "hints": [
    "Immediate assertions are procedural (checked immediately).",
    "Concurrent assertions express temporal relationships across cycles."
  ],
  "solution": {
    "language": "systemverilog",
    "code": "property p_req_ack; @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (req |-> ##[1:3] ack); endproperty\nassert property (p_req_ack) else $error(\"Req->Ack not observed within 1..3 cycles\");"
