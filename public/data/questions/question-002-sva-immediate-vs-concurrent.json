  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["systemverilog", "assertions", "sva"],
  "description": "Scenario: A bus request should be acknowledged shortly after it's asserted, otherwise a bug occurred. Write a concurrent SVA that checks 'req' implies 'ack' within 1–3 cycles and is disabled during reset.\n\nDiagram:\n  clk: ↑   ↑   ↑\n  req: 1   0   0\n  ack: 0   1   0\n\nExplain why 'disable iff (reset)' is important.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (req |-> ##[1:3] ack));",
      "output": "Checks that whenever req is true, ack follows within 1 to 3 clock cycles; assertion ignored while reset is asserted.",
      "explanation": "This is a concurrent assertion (temporal) with 'disable iff' guarding reset."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": "Signals must be sampled on the same clock domain.",
  "hints": [
    "Immediate assertions are procedural (checked immediately).",
    "Concurrent assertions express temporal relationships across cycles."

  "solution": {
    "language": "systemverilog",
    "code": "property p_req_ack; @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (req |-> ##[1:3] ack); endproperty\nassert property (p_req_ack) else $error(\"Req->Ack not observed within 1..3 cycles\");"
