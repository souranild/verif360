  "description": "Scenario: Some packet combinations are rare but critical (e.g., error states). Design coverpoints and weight bins so rare events are visible and prioritized. Explain how you'd schedule tests to focus on low-coverage, high-risk bins.\n\nDiagram (bins):\n  bins: { normal (80%), rare_error (5%), corruption (0.1%) } — weight rare bins higher",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "coverpoint pkt.type with bins normal, rare_error, corruption; weight corruption higher",
      "output": "Coverage report highlights low hits for 'corruption' bin; target tests to increase hits for it",
      "explanation": "Use bin weights and cross with other fields; instrument driver to bias generation when needed."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": "Avoid over-biasing tests such that production-like behavior is lost; use directed tests alongside constrained-random runs.",
  "hints": [
    "Use 'weight' or pragma to mark bins more important.",
    "Use targeted sequences that force rare states for regression tests."
  ],
  "solution": {
    "language": "systemverilog",
    "code": "covergroup cg @(posedge clk);\n  type_cp: coverpoint pkt.type { bins normal = {0}; bins rare_error = {1}; bins corruption = {2}; option.weight = 10; }\n  // cross and sample when valid\nendgroup"
