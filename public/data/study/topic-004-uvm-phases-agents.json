This page expands on roles and best practices for agents.\n\n## Anatomy of an Agent\n- **Driver**: converts transactions to pin-level signals.\n- **Monitor**: observes signals and creates transactions (TLM).\n- **Sequencer/Sequence**: drives driver with sequence_items.\n- **Scoreboard**: compares DUT output with reference model.\n",
