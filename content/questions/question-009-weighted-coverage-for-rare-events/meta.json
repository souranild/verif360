  "description": "Design coverpoints and weight bins so rare events are visible and prioritized. Explain how you'd schedule tests to focus on low-coverage, high-risk bins.",
  "examples": [
    { "input": "coverpoint pkt.type with bins normal, rare_error, corruption; weight corruption higher", "output": "Coverage report highlights low hits for 'corruption' bin; target tests to increase hits for it", "explanation": "Use bin weights and cross with other fields; instrument driver to bias generation when needed." }
  ],
  "constraints": "Avoid over-biasing tests such that production-like behavior is lost; use directed tests alongside constrained-random runs.",
  "hints": ["Use 'weight' or pragma to mark bins more important.", "Use targeted sequences that force rare states for regression tests."],
  "solution": { "language": "systemverilog", "code": "covergroup cg @(posedge clk);\n  type_cp: coverpoint pkt.type { bins normal = {0}; bins rare_error = {1}; bins corruption = {2}; option.weight = 10; }\n  // cross and sample when valid\nendgroup" },
