  "description": "Explain when you'd use formal vs simulation and write an SVA property that asserts mutual exclusion for grant1 and grant2.",
  "examples": [
    { "input": "assert property (@(posedge clk) !(grant1 && grant2));", "output": "Formal finds violations where both grant1 and grant2 are asserted simultaneously.", "explanation": "Formal is excellent for exhaustive corner-case proof." }

  "solution": { "language": "systemverilog", "code": "property p_mutual_excl; @(posedge clk) !(grant1 && grant2); endproperty\nassert property (p_mutual_excl) else $error(\"Mutual exclusion violated\");" },
