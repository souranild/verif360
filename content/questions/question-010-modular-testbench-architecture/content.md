# Modular Testbench — design agents, TLM interfaces and scoreboards

Sketch the architecture and explain responsibilities of drivers, monitors, agents and the scoreboard.

## Sketch

env { agent0, agent1 } ; agent contains driver/monitor/sequencer; monitor transmits TLM transactions to scoreboard; scoreboard compares to reference.
