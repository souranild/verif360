  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["testbench", "scoreboard", "monitor", "protocol"],
  "description": "Design a scoreboard that compares observed output transactions to expected reference model results and flags ordering, duplication or loss.",
  "examples": [
    { "input": "Expected: [0x10, 0x11, 0x12]\nObserved: [0x10, 0x12, 0x11]", "output": "Scoreboard reports ordering violation.", "explanation": "Maintain a queue of expected transactions and compare each observed transaction in-order; log mismatches and context." }
  ],
  "constraints": "Assume a single producer and consumer; timestamps may be used for ordering but be careful with out-of-order delivery due to parallelism.",
  "hints": ["Use transaction-level abstraction (structs/objects) for packets.", "Keep a reference model (e.g., a simple FIFO) to derive expected outputs."],
  "solution": { "language": "pseudo", "code": "// Pseudo: scoreboard logic\nexpected_q.push(expected_transaction);\nwhen observed_transaction arrives:\n  if expected_q.empty() -> report unexpected\n  else if observed != expected_q.peek() -> report ordering/duplication/loss and attempt recovery\n  else expected_q.pop();" },
