  "difficulty": "medium",
  "tags": ["coverage", "systemverilog", "functional-coverage"],
  "description": "Capture what your tests miss: write a covergroup that samples packet.type and packet.len, cross them, and explain how you'd use the resulting report to hunt down coverage holes.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "covergroup pkt_cg @(posedge clk); type_cp: coverpoint pkt.type { bins read = {0}; bins write = {1}; } len_cp: coverpoint pkt.len; cross_cp: cross type_cp, len_cp; endgroup",
      "output": "Coverage report shows percentages per bin and cross; missing crosses indicate scenarios to add as directed tests or constraint tweaks.",
      "explanation": "Use cross coverage and weight bins if needed; use assertions and directed tests to exercise uncovered combos."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": "Sample at a stable point after packet fields are assigned.",
  "hints": ["Use 'iff' qualifiers to avoid sampling during invalid states.", "Use 'option.per_instance=1' when needed."],
  "solution": { "language": "systemverilog", "code": "covergroup pkt_cg @(posedge clk);\n  type_cp: coverpoint pkt.type { bins r = {0}; bins w = {1}; }\n  len_cp: coverpoint pkt.len;\n  cross_cp: cross type_cp, len_cp;\nendgroup\n// Instantiate and sample in monitor when packet valid" },
